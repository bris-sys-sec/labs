Systems Security Labs
=====================

This repository contains the lab sheets for the Systems Security (COMSM1500) course.
There is a separarte folder for each lab under [Labs](https://github.com/bris-sys-sec/labs/tree/master/Labs), and each lab sheet is given as the README inside its lab folder.
Where code is reference in a lab sheet, you will find it under the same directory.

You should start with [Lab 0](https://github.com/bris-sys-sec/labs/tree/master/Labs/0_Pre-lab), which explains how to set up the virtual machines and software that you will need throughout this course.
The scripts that set up the VMs are found in the [VMs](https://github.com/bris-sys-sec/labs/tree/master/VMs) folder, and you should run all the Vagrant commands inside it.
