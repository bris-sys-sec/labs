Lab 3: SQL Injection
====================

Preparation
-----------

Start the server VM:

```bash
$ vagrant up vm3s
```

A port is automatically forwarded to your host, so you can access the Collabtive web application at <http://localhost:8080> (no internet access required).
The default username/password is `admin`/`admin`.
From the admin panel you will see that there are the also users `alice`, `peter`, `bob`, `ted` and `seed`—you can probably guess their passwords.

The application is written in PHP and runs on a locally hosted apache2 server with source files in `/var/www/SQL/Collabtive` and a MYSQL database.

First we will turn off magic quotes, a PHP protection mechanism that escapes quotes in user input (such as form fields).
To do this, open the file `/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini` as root and change line 756 to read:

```php
magic_quotes_gpc = Off
```

Then run the command:

```bash
$ sudo service apache2 restart
```

In the past, we used the [Tamper Data extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tamper-data/), but this no longer works with newer version of the browser.
Whenever your browser sent a request, the extension let you tamper with the parameters.
_If you want_ to this particular extension, one approach is to install a desktop environment and an older version of Firefox in your Ubuntu 12.04 VM.
You can also look for other extensions that accomplish a similar task, but _this is not required_.

For a task to be complete, it has to run on an unmodified version of the lab application unless the task says otherwise.
You may want to run a modified version on a second VM however where you can add extra logging.
For example, to have a peek at the SQL statements being constructed, you could change the login statement as follows:

```php
$q = "SELECT ID ...
file_put_contents("/tmp/log", "SQL: " . $q . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
$sel1 = mysql_query($q);
```

This appends the generated SQL to a file that you can watch with `tail -f` in a terminal.

Task 1: SQL injection on the login form
---------------------------------------

Your first task is to login as `admin` without knowing the password.
The typical SQL injection attack works along the following lines: if the constructed query is:


```sql
SELECT ID FROM users WHERE name = '$user' AND pass = '$pass'
```

... then entering the following values:

```
user: admin
pass: ' OR '' = '
```

... would interpolate to:

```sql
SELECT ID FROM users WHERE name = 'admin' AND pass = '' OR '' = ''
```

which goes around the password check.

This won't work directly for us: the login code starts at line 363 of `/var/www/SQL/Collabtive/include/class.user.php` and looks like this:

```php
function login($user, $pass)
{
    if (!$user)
    {
        return false;
    }

    $pass = sha1($pass);
    $sel1 = mysql_query("SELECT ID,name,locale,lastlogin,gender
                         FROM user WHERE (name = '$user' OR
                         email = '$user') AND pass = '$pass'");
    $chk = mysql_fetch_array($sel1);
    if ($chk["ID"] != "")
    {
        ... // set up session
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

We can't do anything with `$pass` because it's hashed.
To make things worse, `$user` lives inside brackets too.

**Hint**: the `#` character starts an SQL comment until the end of line.

- **Task 1.1**: Log into the admin account without knowing the password.
- **Task 1.2**: Explain why you can't use this particular query to overwrite data.

For Task 1.2, once you've figured out how to get the SQL injection running it would be really tempting to do something like this:

```sql
... ; UPDATE user SET pass = 'c6dda4f283c9e13682ea3aef2e1732dd80b63cbc'
WHERE name = 'admin';
```

That hex string is the SHA1 hash of `owned`.
The semicolon separates SQL statements.
Unfortunately this _will not work_.
Your Task 1.2 is to explain why not.

Task 2: SQL injection on UPDATE
---------------------------------

Log in as Peter and go to My Account -> Edit (wrench icon).
Submitting this form runs an `UPDATE` statement (function `edit` on line 82 of `user.class.php`).
You can see in the source that the programmer applied `mysql_real_escape_string` to most parameters but "forgot" this for the `$company` one.

- **Task 2.1**: As Peter, overwrite information in Bob's account (try changing his e-mail to `peter@evil.com`). _But don't change Bob's name!_
- **Task 2.2**: Still as Peter, change Bob's password to `peter`, again without changing Bob's name.

Task 3: Countermeasures
-------------------------

- **Task 3.1**: Explain what the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting does that I asked you to turn off at the beginning.
Show what happens when you attempt your attack from Task 1.1 with magic quotes on (you can log queries as described in [Preparation](#preparation)).
You will have to restart the apache2 service after editing the `php.ini` file.
- **Task 3.2**: Explain what `mysql_real_escape_string` does (for extra marks, also compare it to the version without `real_`).
Explain what happens to your attack in Task 2.1 with this protection activated for the company field too. (Turn magic quotes _off_ again for this task.)
- **Task 3.3**: Explain how _prepared statements_ can secure a database query.
How would you use a prepared statement for the login function?
