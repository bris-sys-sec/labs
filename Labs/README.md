# Outline

This year there will be four lab tasks split into two pieces of coursework. Each coursework is worth 30% of the unit mark and the remaining 40% comes from a final exam.
-	Coursework 1 covers labs 1 and 2 (format strings and buffer overflows). These labs are in weeks 5 and 6 and Coursework 1 is due in week 7.
-	Coursework 2 covers labs 3 and 4 (networks and SQL injection). These labs are in week 9 and 10 and Coursework 2 is due in week 11.

For each coursework, you will work in groups of 2. We will sort out groups before the labs begin.
You will get an opportunity to form groups of your own by a deadline (to be an-nounced in the lectures), after which I will randomly assign the remaining students to groups.

**Admin suggests that there will be over 80 students on the unit this year.
Please understand that I do not have the time to create group assignments based on everyone’s preferences with some kind of matching algorithm – you will get the opportunity to form your own groups of four, anyone not in a group by the deadline must work with whoever they get as their randomly assigned partner.**

# Technical and Reflective sections

For each lab, you must include two sections in your coursework:

-	A technical section, describing what you did and how/why it works.
Imagine that you are writing for another student who has not taken this unit: they should be able, after reading your technical part, to both reproduce your attacks by following the steps you give and to have a basic understanding of what is happening.
-	A reflective section, in which you critically reflect on and discuss solutions relating to **one** of the vulnerabilities seen in the associated technical section.
The reflective section require a significant amount of self-directed research to achieve a top grade.
You will be expected to read through the academic literature and to produce a critical survey.
You may want to refer to this [document](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1112/R01/p83-keshav.pdf)
as a guideline.

The technical section account for 40% of your coursework grade, while the reflective section account for 60%.

# Submission rules

To help with the marking process, in particular getting the marks and feedback back to you in good time, you must follow the rules in this section.
Some of the rules are also designed to limit the amount of work you are expected to do for the coursework on this unit.
Please read the rules carefully – deviations that disrupt the marking process may result in losing marks.

## General rules
-	For each coursework, you must submit two pdf files, one containing the technical sections and one containing the reflective sections.
The names of the files should make clear which is which.
-	**You must submit PDF files**, not text files, word documents, JPEGs of scanned documents, TeX sources etc.  
Anything else will receive 0 marks.
Exception: if you wish to submit scripts or other code along with your PDF reports for certain tasks, you may do this.
-	Marking will be anonymous.
You must include the candidate numbers (5-digit numbers, NOT your usernames) of all group members clearly visible on the first page of every PDF document that you submit and you must not include personally identifying information such as your real name or university username anywhere.

## Reflective sections
For the reflective sections, you must submit a PDF file with exactly 4 pages (excluding references) per coursework:
-	Pages 1-2 must contain the reflective section for the first lab.
-	Pages 3-4 must contain the reflective section for the second lab.
-	Your candidate numbers must be included on at least pages 1 and 3.
- You must use the provided [template](https://github.com/bris-sys-sec/labs/tree/master/Labs/0_template).

The reason for these rules is so that I can print all reflections, easily sort them into “lab 1” and “lab 2” piles and then mark them efficiently together with my TAs while trying my hardest to make the assignment and marking scale the same for everyone, be able to cross-check marks for consistency at the end and still get everything marked (I hope) within 3 weeks.
Each reflection will be marked out of 10 according to the M-scale (i.e. 7/10 is already “excellent”).
Minor violations of the page limit rule will result in a penalty of 0.5 marks.
You will receive written feedback on your reflections, uploaded as a text file to SAFE.

## Technical sections
There is no strict limit for these but don’t go overboard. I suggest an upper limit of 4 pages per lab. Anything over 8 pages (including images, references) is probably excessive for most of the labs.
Do not take any screenshots of terminals: instead, copy and paste the text and format it in a monospace font.
You will receive a mark out of 10 for each technical section and feedback in a text file uploaded to SAFE.

## Work distribution
All group members are responsible for all the submitted work.
Only one member of each group needs to submit to SAFE.
You may not assign individual sections to different group members, but all group members are responsible for all sections.
**There will be no grade adjustment based on how you internally distributed the work**.

## Plagiarism
Plagiarism is normally not much of a problem on the MEng cohorts, nonetheless please remember and follow the following rules and ask me if there are any questions about this.

-	Your coursework that you submit must be your own group's work.
-	Any material you use must be properly referenced/cited.
-	Direct quotes from sources must be marked as such. For text, this generally means place it in quotation marks and reference it; for code, include a comment at the top of the file or function in question indicating the source; for images/figures this means put something like “source: (reference)” as a legend below the image.
-	Under no circumstances can you copy from other groups' reports.

The SEED labs that we use are a well established teaching tool and there are Q&A and sample solutions to them on the internet. You are allowed to read and reference material on the internet like any other sources, and you are strongly encouraged to do your own further research and reference things that you found in your reports.

# Marking and feedback

In a masters-level unit, you are expected to demonstrate evidence of research and reflection beyond the material taught in the lectures and labs in order to obtain a top grade. Doing everything on the exercise sheet correctly to the letter should get you 65%; marks above that are for contributions beyond the expected minimum in terms of quality.

Quality is more important than quantity; a report that makes a point well in one page is better than one that does the same task in four pages but does not highlight the important points or have a clear structure.
The worst thing you can do is spend hours and hours writing a 50-page report that tries to deal with everything including the kitchen sink, but ends up being poorly structured and missing the key points of the attacks in question.
It won't get you a high mark and it's a waste of your time (each section is worth around 0.625% of your final year).

The following are examples of quality:
-	attack descriptions and explanations that are both clear and concise
-	explaining how one could develop the attacks further, or apply similar techniques to other vulnerabilities
-	effectively combining the “what” and the “why” of the attacks
-	referencing relevant material outside of the unit resources
-	real-world examples of instances of the attacks discussed
-	good writing style and structure
-	highlighting the key concepts involved
-	categorising the attacks/vulnerabilities and placing them in a larger context or comparing with other attacks
-	assessing the prevalence, impact/severity or the difficulty of mitigating a class of attack –  with supporting evidence (e.g. references to OWASP or similar vulnerability classification resources)
-	individual contributions of your own that I have not thought of here, but that are relevant to the vulnerabilities/attacks being discussed

Each group will receive individual, written feedback on all tasks. I hope to be able to return all feedback within the university guideline of 3 weeks from the submission date (however, please do keep in mind that TAs are also students and are allowed holidays).
The reflective and technical sections carry a weight of 40% and 60% respectively.
This is an M-level course and significant self-directed research beyond the lecture content is expected.
The tasks I've asked you to do cannot be marked simply by checking how many boxes of a standardised marking sheet you've ticked.
You deserve feedback of at least the same quality as the coursework that you hand in, and that means I will read each and every one of your reports in detail – which I'm happy to do (and I’m paid to do) but it also means I cannot absolutely guarantee feedback by a fixed deadline.

# Mark scheme

## Technical reports

The grading scheme is to be applied on each question individually.
The results are then translated over 10, not that grade transposition is not done on a linear scale.
Obtaining mostly 3s will land you a grade around 65%, while going above 70% requires a large number of 4s.
Mostly 2s will lead to a grade of around 55% and mostly 1s will lead to a grade around 40%.

| Grade | Meaning                    |
|-------|----------------------------|
| 0     | The task was not attempted |
| 1     | The task was attempted but there are major flaws, for example: 1) the attack does not work most of the time; 2) Code that does not compile; 3) the write-up contains serious mistakes that mean it won't work if you follow the instructions; 4) key steps are missing in the write-up. |
| 2     | The attack works (most of the time) but there are flaws, e.g. 1) the attack only works some of the time, but there is an obvious attack that always works; 2) typos in the write-up that affect the attack, even though it's clear the students got it to work; 3) ambiguous instructions – the students may have got the attack to work,
but someone following the instructions to the letter would be unlikely to. |
| 3     | following the instructions gets the attack to work. |
| 4     | the attack not only works by following the instructions but it goes beyond what
one would expect – for example: 1) students have found a shortcut that we have not anticipated; 2) students have performed a more general version of the attack than the one described; 3) students have written a script for an attack where getting it to work
manually was all that was needed – AND their script always works |
